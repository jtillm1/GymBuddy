## About Me
I am a junior in computer science with a concentration in data science. I have lived in 8 different places but was born and mainly grew up in Maryland. I like to spend my free time staying active by going to the gym or playing sports with friends, watching movies, playing video games, or doing random activities with friends.

## My CSC340 Goals
