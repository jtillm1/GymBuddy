        <h2>Why GymBuddy Was Created</h2>
        <p>
            Finding the right gym can be difficult. Every gym offers different
            equipment styles, membership plans, and amenities. GymBuddy was
            created to simplify the process by helping customers find gyms
            that align with their preferences while also allowing gym owners
            to showcase what makes their facility unique.

            Features include: 
            Allows customers to set location and price preferences
            Matches users with gyms based on equipment style
            Gives gym owners a platform to list amenities and plans
            Creates a structured comparison between gym options
